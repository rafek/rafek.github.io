              Being in the industry since 2007 and working for several different
              organisations allowed me to gain a fair amount of experience in a
              variety of technologies and work environments.

            <p>
              I worked for companies of various sizes and industries. Within
              teams that were entirely on-site and distributed globally. I started
              with .NET based desktop applications, then moved to Microsoft web
              stack where I endured both sides of ASP.NET: WebForms and MVC.
              After delivering more than a handful of web apps, I jumped into
              the world of mobile and got involved in native iOS development
              followed by projects utilising cross-platform solutions like
              Cordova or Xamarin. I also spent a decent time in the glorious
              kingdom of JavaScript doing both backend and frontend. As of 2017,
              I do mostly <abbr title="Augmented Reality">AR</abbr> and
              <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> with Windows Mixed Reality
              platform. Occasional Python backend development is also an excellent
              springboard for me. In February 2018 I was awarded Microsoft MVP
              award in Windows Development for my engagement in Microsoft Mixed Reality.
