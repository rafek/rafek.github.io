            <p>
              Sometime before I started my professional career as a software
              developer I read a book that had a great impact on how I would
              think and act as a professional. <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer: From
              Journeyman to Master</a> is packed with good practices for software
              craftsmen, especially newcomers. One of the sentences that struck
              me the most was: <em>"You shouldn't be wedded to any particular
              technology, but have a broad enough background and experience
              base to allow you to choose good solutions in particular
              situations."</em>. That one really stuck with me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being in the industry since 2007 and working for several different
              organizations allowed me to gain a fair amount of experience in a
              variety of technologies and work environments. I worked for
              companies of different sizes and industries. Within teams that
              were fully on-site or distributed globally. I started with .NET
              based desktop applications, then moved to Microsoft web stack
              where I endured both sides of ASP.NET: WebForms and MVC. After
              delivering more than a handful of web apps, I jumped into a mobile
              world and got involved in native iOS development followed by
              projects in cross-platform solutions like Cordova or Xamarin. I
              also spent a decent time in a glorious kingdom of JavaScript doing
              backend and frontend. As of 2017, I do mostly AR and VR with
              Windows Mixed Reality platform. Occasional Python backend
              development is also a good treat.
